User Dashboard Application
Project Overview
This project is a simple dashboard application built using React, JavaScript, and GraphQL. The application fetches and displays a list of users with their details from a GraphQL API. It allows users to search, filter, sort, and paginate through the list of users, providing a clean and user-friendly interface.

Thought Process
1. Choosing the Stack:
React: Chosen for its component-based architecture, which allows for modular and reusable code.
GraphQL: Provides a flexible and efficient way to fetch data, allowing the client to specify exactly what data is needed.
Faker.js: Used to generate mock user data, enabling testing without relying on an external API.
2. Component Design:
UserList Component: Displays the list of users with pagination, search, and sorting functionality.
SearchBar Component: Handles filtering of users by name or email.
SortDropdown Component: Provides options to sort the users by name or company.
UserDetail Component: Shows detailed information about a selected user in a side panel.
3. State Management:
Used React's useState to manage component state.
Considered using a more robust state management solution like Redux, but opted for local state due to the simplicity of the application.
4. GraphQL Integration:
Used Apollo Client to integrate GraphQL into the React application.
Defined the GraphQL schema and resolvers using apollo-server-express for the server-side, allowing flexible querying from the client.
5. Pagination and Sorting:
Implemented server-side pagination and sorting to handle large datasets efficiently.
The client requests only the necessary data for the current page, reducing the amount of data transferred.
6. Assumptions and Decisions:
Mock Data: Assumed the use of mock data generated by Faker.js for simplicity.
Deployment: Decided to deploy the application using Vercel, taking advantage of its seamless integration with GitHub and support for both frontend and backend code.
Styling: Chose Material-UI for a clean and modern UI, but kept the design simple to focus on functionality.
